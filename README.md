# README

This is my second project in Ruby on Rails. After building the blog, I wanted to try something which used real time updating and had more graphics involved. This is why I chose to build a calendar. I followed a couple of guides and watched some tutorials on how to design the graphics and keep track of days and dates along with the months.  

* Ruby version - 3.0.0

The Steps: 
1. Created a new Ruby on Rails project that I could locally host on my machine. 
2. I first started with creating the graphics, which in this case is the table. 
3. Then started adding the weeks and days by pulling data from a json API that gave real-time days and weeks. 
4. This was one of the most difficult steps where along with step 3, I was creating the application module for the project. 
5. I then created a controller.
6. I added a route and helper file to host on a local server. 
7. The last step was mostly done using guides online where I had to merge the data representation with the tables created.
